# How to run

1. Clone this repository.
2. In order to generate fake database in **json** folder, we run:
```sh
cd json
npm install
```
and then we can use our fake JSON server at port 1209!

**Note**: Default username (password is the same with username) for normal user: normaluser@gmail.com and master user: masteruser@gmail.com

2.1. If you want to customized your own JSON server? No problem, create new folder and then:
```sh
npm init
npm install -D json-server json-server-auth
```
2.2. Create your own database inside ``` db.json ``` file. In ``` package.json ```, change the following line:
```sh
{
...
"start": "json-server db.json -m ./node_modules/json-server-auth --port 1209"
...
}
```
**Note**: You can change your server's port here!
2.3. After that, we can start our server using:
```sh
npm start
```

3. Finally, in the main repository, we run:
```sh
npm init
npm run dev 
```
